    The freshmaker backend runs as a fedmsg-hub process here.
    
    It listens to events from fedmsg and requests rebuilds of compound
    artifacts, mediated by some policy in the config.

    This host:
    
    - relies on db01 for its database of activity (what has been rebuilt?)
    - Will need access to commit to the modules namespace of dist-git.
    - Will need token-based access to ODCS to request repos.
    - Will need token-based access to MBS to request module builds.
    - Will need a kerberos principle to request container builds from koji/osbs.
