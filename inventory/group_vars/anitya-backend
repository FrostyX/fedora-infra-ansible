csi_relationship: |
    There are a few things running here:

    - A number of cronjobs that scrape upstreams for new releases
    - A postgres database server to be used by those crons and by
      anitya-frontend01

    - This host relies on:
      - The fedmsg-relay daemon running on anitya-frontend01.
      - Lots of external third-party services.  The cronjobs make all kinds of
        requests out to the Internet that can fail in various ways.

    - Things that rely on this host:
      - The webapps running on anitya-frontend01 relies on the postgres db
        server running on this node.
