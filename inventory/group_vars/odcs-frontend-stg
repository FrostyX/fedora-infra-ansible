# 1) mod_wsgi is configured to use the vars for its own setup
# 2) iptables opens enough ports for all threads for fedmsg

    The apache/mod_wsgi app is the only thing really running here

    This host:
    
    - relies on db01 for its database of activity (what composes have been
      requested and what state are they in?)
    - It also mounts an nfs shared provided by odcs-backend01.
    - It provides http access to the compose contents on that nfs share.
