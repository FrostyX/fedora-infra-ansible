# 1) mod_wsgi is configured to use the vars for its own setup
# 2) iptables opens enough ports for all threads for fedmsg

    The apache/mod_wsgi app is the only thing really running here

    It should only be used to report status on what's happening with the
    freshmaker backend.  The freshmaker frontend doesn't receive requests for
    activity.

    This host:
    
    - relies on db01 for its database of activity (what rebuilds are in
      progress, and why?)
