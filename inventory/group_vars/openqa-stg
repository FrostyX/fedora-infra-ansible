# This setup is a bit out of the ordinary for a staging system. As the openqa
# scheduler needs up-to-date information from the wiki and koji, it doesn't
# work well as a proper staging host.
#
# We decided to keep it a pseudo-staging host that will get new versions of
# openqa first and will be a staging host for most intensive purposes but from
# a firewall rule POV, it will be a staging-friendly production host
#
# it should still be using the stg proxies and the external hostname will still
# be stg.fedoraproject.org

# this is to enable nested virt, which we need for disk image creation
