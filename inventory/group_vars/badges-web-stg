csi_purpose: Run the 'tahrir' mod_wsgi app to display badges.fedoraproject.org
csi_relationship: |
    The apache/mod_wsgi app is the only thing really running here

    * This host relies on:
      * db01 for its database of badge awards (and users, etc..)
      * a collection of .pngs in /usr/share/badges/pngs put there by ansible
      * memcached!

    * Conversely, a few things rely on this site:
      * We have a mediawiki plugin that hits a JSON endpoint to display badges.
        It should be resilient, but issues in the badges app may cascade into
        mediawiki issues in the event of faults.
      * fedora-mobile (the android app) queries the JSON api here.
      * zodbot has a .badges <username> command that queries the JSON api here.
      * openbadges.org may call back to this app to verify that badge assertions
        are really certified by us (this will happen anytime someone exports
        their fedora badges to the mozilla universe via the tahrir web
        interface, but may also happen later in the future to ensure we did not
        revoke such and such badge).
