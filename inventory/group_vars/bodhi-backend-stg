csi_relationship: |
    The mashing of repos here happens as part of the 'fedmsg-hub' daemon.  Check
    logs with 'journalctl -u fedmsg-hub'.  Check the bodhi masher docs/code for
    more detail on what it does:
    https://github.com/fedora-infra/bodhi/blob/develop/bodhi/consumers/masher.py

    * This host relies on:
      * db01 for its database, which is shares with the bodhi2 frontend nodes.
      * An NFS mount of koji data in /mnt/koji/
      * The fedmsg bus for triggering mashes.
      * XMLRPC calls to koji for tagging and untagging updates.
      * bugzilla for posting comments about status changes
      * the wiki for getting information about QA "Test Cases"
      * taksotron (resultsdb) for getting status-check results (gating updates).

    * No other systems rely directly on this host.  Everything depends on it
      indirectly for the creation of new updates repos (which get synced out to
      the master mirror for distribution.
