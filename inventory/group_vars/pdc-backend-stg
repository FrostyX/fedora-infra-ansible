csi_relationship: |
 NOTICE - pdc-backend01 and pdc-backend02 do *different* things.  They both run
 a fedmsg-hub daemon that loads the pdc-updater consumer plugin.  However, the
 pdc-updater plugin is configured to do different things in each place.

 On pdc-updater01, the compose handler is enabled which listens for new pungi
 composes, and stores them in PDC.  Fedora QE uses this data.  The consumer
 has only a single thread enabled to avoid OOMing itself with more than one
 compose at a time.

 On pdc-updater02, the dep chain and modularity handlers are enabled which
 listen for koji and MBS activity, and store that in PDC.  Multiple threads
 are enabled so that it can work more efficiently on these smaller tasks.
