csi_relationship: |
    There is an odcs backend process running here.

    This host:
    
    - relies on db01 for its database of activity (what composes have been
      requested and what state are they in?)
    - Uses pungi to compose repos of content.
    - It also *provides* an nfs share used by odcs-frontend01.
