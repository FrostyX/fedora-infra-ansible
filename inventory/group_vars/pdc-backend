 NOTICE - The three pdc-backend do *different* things.  They all run a
 fedmsg-hub daemon that loads the pdc-updater consumer plugin.  However, the
 pdc-updater plugin is configured to do different things in each place.

 On pdc-backend01, the compose handler is enabled which listens for new pungi
 composes, and stores them in PDC.  Fedora QE uses this data.  The consumer
 has only a single thread enabled to avoid OOMing itself with more than one
 compose at a time.

 On pdc-backend02, the modularity handlers are enabled which listen for MBS
 activity, and store that in PDC.  pdc-backend02 also hosts the retirement
 handler which listens to dist-git for new dead.package files, and propagates
 the retirement to PDC (by prematurely EOLing the branch).  Multiple threads are
 enabled so that it can work more efficiently on these smaller tasks.

 On pdc-backend03, the dep chain handlers are enabled which listen for koji
 messages and store dep chain information in PDC, like what rpms depend on what
 other rpms at build time, and what containers depend on what rpms, etc..
 Multiple threads are enabled so that it can work more efficiently on these
 smaller tasks.
