# to each of them (one for each wsgi thread).  We're not doing that here because
# the anitya frontend is sitting on the vpn.  We could, but we'd like to reduce
# vpn traffic.  Instead, we configure the anitya app to connect directly to the
# fedmsg-relay sitting on busgateway01.vpn.fp.o and send its messages there.
