# here we keep variables that are used on all openQA boxes, servers
# and workers, prod and lab.

# this is UID and GID of geekotest on the server (the user openQA
# runs as). The asset dirs are owned by this user and group. We also
# create geekotest on the workers with this GID and add _openqa-worker
# to that group, so os-autoinst can write to the asset dirs, which it
# needs to do when uncompressing compressed disk assets.
