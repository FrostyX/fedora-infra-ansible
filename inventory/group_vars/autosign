    This host will run the autosigner.py script which should automatically sign
    new rawhide and branched builds.  It listens to koji over fedmsg for
    notifications of new builds, and then asks sigul, the signing server, to
    sign the rpms and store the new rpm header back in Koji.

    The script[1] currently runs in the foreground from a git checkout.
