# openQA tap worker hosts (like this one) do stuff with ifcfg that base
# doesn't understand. terrible, terrible stuff. seriously - it doesn't
# handle the openvswitch config well. so let's tell it to just configure
# the regular interfaces (which on this system is eth0 and eth1) for us,
# disabling all but the one we want to use (eth0), and leave everything
# else alone.
