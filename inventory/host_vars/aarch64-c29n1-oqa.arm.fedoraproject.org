# openQA tap worker hosts (like this one) do stuff with ifcfg that base
# doesn't understand. terrible, terrible stuff. seriously - it doesn't
# handle the openvswitch config well. so let's tell it to just configure
# the actual connected interface (which on this system is eth0) for us
# and leave everything else alone.
