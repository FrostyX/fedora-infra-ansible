    ns01 is a master dns server. 
    It serves about every domain under fedoraproject, fedo*, as well as others, both forward and reverse. 

    * This host relies on:
    - The virthost it's hosted on (vmhost-x86-01.iad2.fedoraproject.org)
    - batcave for dns git and keys
    - connectivity to maxmind to create geoIP dns acl
    
    * Things that rely on this host:
    - The Internet/Community to resolve everything related to fedora and reverse-IP for allocated subnets
    - If this host is down, dns queries will slow down by the portion of this host to the total name servers responsible for the same domain set.
    - secodary/slave dns servers
