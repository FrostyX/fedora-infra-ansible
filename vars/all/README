This directory contains variables (one per file) that are loaded into 
various playbooks. The first set of these is to allow templates to 
handle the various stages of Fedora development so we don't have to 
remember all the places that need changing. 

There's 3 states: 

1:

Rawhide N+1
Fedora N (stable)
Fedora N-1 (stable)

2: We branch a new release from rawhide: 

Rahide N+2
Fedora N+1 (pre)
Fedora N (stable)
Fedora N-1 (stable)

3. That release is released:

Rawhide N+1
Fedora N (stable)
Fedora N-1 (stable)
Fedora N-2 (stable)
