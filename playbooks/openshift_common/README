This file contains playbooks imported from the upstream OpenShift Ansible
github repository[0].

In order to re-import/update these scripts,

    # This can really be anywhere, just outside this git tree
    $ cd /tmp/

    $ git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible.git

    # Assuming your local copy of this git repo lives in ~/src/fedora-ansible/
    $ cp -r \
        openshift-ansible/playbooks/common/* \
        ~/src/fedora-ansible/playbooks/openshift_common/

There are relative symlinks involved and at the time of this writing, the
directory structure of this git repository matches where appropriate with the
upstream repository making this mostly a clean import.
