  # First -- a sanity check.  We want this to fail and stop the playbook if
  # someone typoed and reponame.  The "command" here claims that it "creates" a
  # file.  That is not actually true, but it tells ansible to not bother running
  # the command *if* that creates= file is already present.  Its a hackaround to
  # make this task idempotent.
