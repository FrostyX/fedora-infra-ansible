#
# setup a transient instance in the Fedora infrastructure private cloud
#
# This playbook is used to spin up a transient instance for someone to test something. 
# In particular transient instances will all be terminated at least by the next 
# maint window for the cloud, but ideally people will terminate instances they 
# are done using. 
#
# If you have an application or longer term item that should always be around
# please use the persistent playbook instead.
#
# You MUST pass a name to it, ie: -e 'name=somethingdescriptive'
# You can optionally override defaults by passing any of the following: 
# image=imagename (default is centos70_x86_64)
# instance_type=some instance type (default is m1.small)
# root_auth_users='user1 user2 user3' (default is sysadmin-main group)
#
