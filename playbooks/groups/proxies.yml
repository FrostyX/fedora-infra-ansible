  # TODO
  #
  # - fedora-web::build (bapp0*)
  # - fedora-docs::build (bapp0*)
  # - review-stats::build (bapp0*)
  # - membership-map::build (bapp0*)
  #
  ## TBD
  # - sysctl ip_conntrack_max bits  - do we still need this on rhel7?
  # - semanage ports.. we're likely going to need one for every app.
  # - sebooleans.. let's try running first, see what gets blocked, and then
  #                selectively enable where semanage port fails
  #
  ## Not going to do
  # - smolt::proxy -- note going to do this.  smolt is dead.  long live smolt.
  # - domainnotarget stuff - only smolt used this
