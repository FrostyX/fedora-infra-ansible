# Expire old repo metadata from mirrormanager
#
# This playbook will mark all older versions of a distro version to be outdated
# so that metalink will not serve <alternates> for old versions.
# CAUTION: Until mirrors pick up the new content, this will mean that the master
# mirror is the only one deemed respectable, and as such should be used very
# sparingly!
#
# requires --extra-vars="product=Fedora version=23"
#
# Possible product: Fedora/EPEL/RHEL
