# requires --extra-vars="vhost=somevhost fqdn"

#General overview:
# talk to the vhost
# get back list of instances
# add each of their hostnames to an addhoc group
# halt each of them in a second play
# wait for them to die
# third play, reboot the vhost
#     wait for vhost to come back

# TO BE DONE - should be fixable w/ansible 0.9
# wait for all of the instances to return(?)
# compare the first list to the second for state info
# how to do this:
# capture output of action: virt command=info before halting guests
# compare to same command after vhost comes back
# ansible 0.9 should allow us to preserve content of two registered variables
# across multiple plays
