ansible repository/structure

files - files and templates for use in playbooks/tasks
      - subdirs for specific tasks/dirs highly recommended

inventory - where the inventory and additional vars is stored

library - library of custom local ansible modules

playbooks - collections of plays we want to run on systems

tasks - snippets of tasks that should be included in plays


public path for everything is:

 /srv/web/infra/ansible

private path - which is sysadmin-main accessible only is:

 /srv/private/ansible



cloud instances:
to startup a new cloud instance and configure for basic server use run (as
root):

el6:
ansible-playbook /srv/web/infra/ansible/playbooks/el6-temp-instance.yml

f17: 
ansible-playbook /srv/web/infra/ansible/playbooks/f17-temp-instance.yml


This will setup a new instance, provision it and email sysadmin-main that
the instance was created, it's instance id (for terminating it, attaching
volumes, etc) and it's ip address.

You will then be able to login, as root.
