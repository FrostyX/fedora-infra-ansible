infrastructure ansible style guide
==================================

* run changes through 'ansible-review'. 
  ERRORs must be corrected or rules changed. 
  WARNs should be corrected.

  Rules changes can be proposed to 
  https://pagure.io/cpe/ansible-review-templates/ 

* Use 'yml' instead of 'yaml' 

* do add '.j2' to the end of templates

* in general let readablity trump grepability, ie: 

DONT:
- name: This is some play
  module: name=thing arg=thing2 anotherlongerarg=thing arg4=anodheranth
  
DO:
- name: This is some play
  module:
  - name: thing
  - arg: thing2
..etc
