    # This can be anywhere, just not in this git tree
    $ cd /tmp/

    $ git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible.git
    $ cd openshift-ansible/roles/

    $ oo_roles=(
        etcd
        etcd_ca
        etcd_certificates
        openshift_common
        openshift_examples

        os_env_extras
        os_env_extras_node
        os_firewall
        pods
    )

    # This assumes your local branch of this git repo exists in
    # ~/src/fedora-ansible/ but replace that with the actual path
    $ for role in ${oo_roles[@]}
    do
        cp -r $role ~/src/fedora-ansible/roles/
    done

    # Inspect the changes 
    $ cd ~/src/fedora-ansible
