# [ "`hostname -s`" == "mm-crawler02" ] && sleep 2h is used to start the crawl
# later on the second crawler to reduce the number of parallel accesses to
# the database
#
# To make sure only one cron started crawler is running the previous running
# (cron) crawlers are being signaled to shut down.  The crawler can try to
# gracefully shutdown if it gets the signal SIGALRM(14).  After the signal we
# wait for 5 minutes to give the crawler a chance to shutdown. After that the
# crawler is killed.  To make sure we only end the cron started crawler we look
# for the following process "/usr/bin/python /usr/bin/mm2_crawler --threads 25".
