# Ensure a user exists in RabbitMQ with permissions to only publish.
# This is intended to be something most applications can use, but if you need
# more flexibility, just use the rabbitmq_user module directly.
#
# Required parameters:
#
#   - username (str): the username to create in RabbitMQ, which should match the
#                     CN of the certificate.

# See https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html#permissions for details on
# the RabbitMQ permissions configuration.
