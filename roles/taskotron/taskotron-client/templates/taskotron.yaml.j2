## Main configuration file for Taskotron
## The file is in YAML syntax, read more about it at:
## http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaml
## FIXME: add a link to Taskotron docs

## ==== GENERAL section ====
## There are two major config profiles in Taskotron - development and
## production.
## /Development/ profile is used for developing libtaskotron, developing checks
## based on libtaskotron and local execution of these checks.
## /Production/ profile is used for deploying Taskotron as a service on a
## server, periodically executing the checks and reporting results to relevant
## result consumers.
## *The default profile is /development/*. If you want to switch to the
## /production/ profile, uncomment the following line.
## You can also switch a profile temporarily by using TASKOTRON_PROFILE=name
## environment variable, it has a higher priority. All other options set in this
## file still apply of course.
## [choices: production, development; default: development]
profile: production


## ==== REPORTING section ====
## This section controls which result reports you want to send after the test
## execution is complete

## Overall setting whether to send any reports at all. If this is False, no
## reports will be sent anywhere, regardless of your configuration for
## individual recipient systems.
## [default: True for production, False for development]
reporting_enabled: True

## If True, test results (for selected tests) will be sent as comments to
## Fedora Update System (Bodhi). This requires that you have Bodhi
## credentials filled in secrets.conf.
#report_to_bodhi: True

## Whether to send test results to the configured ResultsDB server.
report_to_resultsdb: True
