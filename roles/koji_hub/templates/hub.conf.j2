## Basic options ##
DBName = koji      
DBUser = koji      
DBHost = db-koji01
DBPass = {{ kojiPassword }}
KojiDir = /mnt/koji       


##  SSL client certificate auth configuration  ##
#note: ssl auth may also require editing the httpd config (conf.d/kojihub.conf)

## the client username is the common name of the subject of their client certificate
DNUsernameComponent = CN
## separate multiple DNs with |
ProxyDNs = emailAddress=buildsys@fedoraproject.org,CN=kojiweb,OU=Fedora Builders,O=Fedora Project,ST=North Carolina,C=US|emailAddress=releng@fedoraproject.org,CN=sign-bridge1,OU=Fedora Builders,O=Fedora Project,ST=North Carolina,C=US

## end SSL client certificate auth configuration



##  Other options  ##
LoginCreatesUser = On
KojiWebURL = http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji
# The domain name that will be appended to Koji usernames
# when creating email notifications
EmailDomain = fedoraproject.org
# weather to send the task owner and package owner email or not on success.  this still goes to watchers
NotifyOnSuccess = True

## If KojiDebug is on, the hub will be /very/ verbose and will report exception
## details to clients for anticipated errors (i.e. koji's own exceptions --
## subclasses of koji.GenericError).
# KojiDebug = On

## Determines how much detail about exceptions is reported to the client (via faults)
## Meaningful values:
##   normal - a basic traceback (format_exception)
##   extended - an extended traceback (format_exc_plus)
##   anything else - no traceback, just the error message
## The extended traceback is intended for debugging only and should NOT be
## used in production, since it may contain sensitive information.
# KojiTraceback = normal

## These options are intended for planned outages
#ServerOffline = True
#OfflineMessage = Offline
# LockOut = False
## If ServerOffline is True, the server will always report a ServerOffline fault (with
## OfflineMessage as the fault string).
## If LockOut is True, the server will report a ServerOffline fault for all non-admin
## requests.
