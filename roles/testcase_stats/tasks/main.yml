# This role installs relval (if needed) and deploys a cron drop-in to
# run `relval testcase-stats` for the next Fedora release once an hour
# and dump the output to a configured location. It also drops an httpd
# config snippet to enable directory indexing and override proxying
# for the location on openQA servers (like the one we expect this role
# to be deployed on). It doesn't actually configure the server to serve
# the directory out - we're currently relying on the openQA Apache
# config to do that, if this role gets split out from the openQA server
# we would need to change that.

# Required vars
# - testcase_stats_output_dir
##      string - Directory where the output should be written.
