First go at a certbot/letsencrypt role for Fedora Infra

To use it:

1) Include the role in your playbook. This will install certbot and put a
   tiny bit of Apache config in place, along with a monthly cron to attempt to
   renew certificates.
2) Add the following lines to your Apache virthost:

  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteRule ^/\.well-known/(.*) /srv/web/acme-challenge/.well-known/$1 [L]

2) ssh to the relevant box

  # TODO: Fix selinux stuff - the cron won't work until it's fixed either.
  service httpd graceful
  setenforce 0
  certbot certonly --manual-public-ip-logging-ok --webroot -w \
    /srv/web/acme-challenge/ -d YOURINSTANCE.fedorainfracloud.org
  setenforce 1
