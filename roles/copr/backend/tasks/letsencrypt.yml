# This playbook is inspired by

# Particularly it follows "(Option B) The Hard Way"

- name: Create The Web Root

- name: Check that cert file exists
  stat:
    path: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/copr-be-dev.cloud.fedoraproject.org/cert.pem"
  register: stat_cert

# This is only for initial setup
# In such case, lighttpd config expects certificate files in /etc/letsencrypt/live,
# but it doesn't exist yet and therefore lighttpd refuses to start at all.
# We will use certbot standalone server to get certificates and then let the playbook to
# parse them and start the lighttpd again.
# Once we have at least some existing certificate files, this step will be skipped.
- name: Should admin run certbot?
