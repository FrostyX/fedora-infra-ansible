# This is a generic role for specifying redirects.  When I ported this over from
# puppet, I looked first at trying to combine all of our redirects into one
# perhaps easier to manage master redirects file.  The trouble I hit was that
# certain redirects need to apply in the context of certain VirtualHost entries
# while not in others.  Consequently, we use this template to stuff the redirect
# role only into the {{website}}/ folder for each site.

# This is the only real work we do.
