These are some static assets we want to serve out to be shared by different
fedora apps.

- The js/ folder contains autologin stuff (ask @puiterwijk)
- The fedora-bootstrap-* folders contain the new fedora bootstrap theme that we
  want to migrate apps to.

---

- The bootstrap-fedora* folders contain an old, deprecated fedora bootstrap
  theme (ask @ralph)
