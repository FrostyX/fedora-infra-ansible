playlets are self-contained playbooks which are never intended to be
directly executed. They are only to be used as an 'include' from our other
playbooks.

All of these playbooks must have:


hosts: $parent_group

the general structure is:

playlet_name/
             vars/vars.yml
             files/myfile.conf
                   myfile2.conf.j2
             handlers/handlers.yml
             book.yml

             
             
                                    
template for book.yml
